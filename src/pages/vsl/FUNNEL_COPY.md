# TFT VSL Funnel -- Complete Copy Document

## Funnel Architecture Overview

```
[Stage 1] VSL Landing Page (video thumbnail + CTA)
    |
    v
[Stage 2] Popup Form (name, email, phone)
    |
    v
[Stage 3] Video Watch Page (full VSL + gated next step)

[Stage 4] Unlock / Next Step (course access + value stack reveal)
```

**Core Strategy:** Lead with a massive curiosity gap. Never mention price. Position TFT as an exclusive, invite-only system that only serious beginners get access to. The VSL does the selling -- the landing page just needs to make them desperate to watch it.

---

## STAGE 1: VSL Landing Page

### Purpose
Get the click. Create an irresistible urge to watch the video. This page should feel like stumbling onto something you weren't supposed to find.

---

### Nav Bar
- TFT Logo (left)
- Links: "What You Get" | "Who This Is For"
- CTA Button: **"Watch the Free Training"**

---

### Hero Section

**Pill Badge (above headline):**
> Free Training -- Limited Access

**Main Headline:**
> The Trading Method So Simple, It Was Designed for Five-Year-Olds.
> It's Making Beginners Dangerous.

**Subheadline:**
> Most trading education is built to confuse you. This one was built to make you competent in weeks, not years. Watch the free training to see exactly how.

**Primary CTA Button:**
> Watch the Free Training

**Trust Indicators (below CTA):**
- "No credit card. No commitment. Just watch."
- "18+ episodes. 4,200+ students. Zero fluff."

---

### Video Thumbnail Section

The video thumbnail should show a compelling still frame with a big play button overlay. Think YouTube-style -- curiosity-driven.

**Thumbnail Overlay Text (on the image):**
> "Why 90% of traders lose -- and the dead-simple fix nobody teaches"

**Below thumbnail, small text:**
> This free training breaks down the exact system behind Trading for Toddlers. Hit play.

---

### Social Proof Strip

**Section Headline:**

**Card 1:**
> "I spent two years watching YouTube and losing money. TFT gave me my first profitable month in three weeks."
> -- Alex R., started from zero

**Card 2:**

### "Who This Is For" Section

- You want to learn the skill, not just follow someone else's trades
- You have a job, school, or life -- and can't stare at screens all day
- You want simple, repeatable rules -- not complicated strategies with 14 indicators

**"This is NOT for you if..." (red X marks):**
- You want someone to tell you exactly what to buy and when
- You're looking for a get-rich-quick signal service
- You aren't willing to practice and put in the reps

## VOICE AND TONE GUIDE

### Brand Voice: TFT
- **Casual but competent.** Talk like a sharp friend who's good at trading, not a professor.
- **Anti-guru.** Never flex. Never use income claims. The product speaks through clarity, not clout.
- **Beginner-friendly.** Assume the reader knows nothing. Never make them feel dumb for not knowing.
- **Direct.** Short sentences. No filler. Say what you mean.
- **Confident, not cocky.** "This works" beats "This will make you rich."

### Words/Phrases TO USE:
- Simple, clean, clear, repeatable, visual, rules-based
- "designed for beginners"
- "step-by-step"
- "no jargon"
- "even if you're starting from zero"
- "the skill, not the signal"

### Words/Phrases to AVOID:
- "guaranteed returns" or any income claim
- "passive income"
- "financial freedom" (overused, triggers skepticism)
- "guru" (unless mocking the concept)
- "secret" (feels scammy)
- "limited time only" (unless genuinely true)
- Excessive urgency language

## KEY COPY PRINCIPLES FOR THIS FUNNEL

1. **Curiosity > Persuasion.** Don't sell on the landing page. Make them curious enough to watch the video. The video does the selling.

2. **Value Stack Without Prices.** Show everything they get. Let the sheer volume of value create its own perceived worth. Prices come later, after they're invested.

3. **Exclusivity Through Qualification.** "This isn't for everyone" is more powerful than "Everyone should try this." Make them self-select.

4. **Proof Through Specificity.** "18+ episodes covering candlesticks, market structure, entry logic, and psychology" beats "a comprehensive trading course."

5. **Reduce Friction Everywhere.** No credit card on the form. No long paragraphs. No multiple CTAs competing. One path forward at every stage.

6. **Match the Existing Brand.** The TFT site uses: "Learn Trading Like You're Five. Win Like a Pro." / "No jargon. No ego. No overwhelm." / "Just clean logic, clear rules, and repeatable systems." -- The VSL funnel copy should feel like it comes from the same voice.
